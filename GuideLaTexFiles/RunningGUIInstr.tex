\Large{How to Run the User Settings GUI}
\end{center}
Our GUI was written in Java and shared in .jar format. This is a file format based on the ZIP file format, and is cross platform, however it requires that Java be installed to be run. If you would like to read Oracle's JAR File Overview that can be found \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html}{\underline{here}}.

The easiest way to install Java is just by getting the most recent version from the \href{https://www.java.com/en/download/}{\underline{Java website download page}}. Our application was built using JDK 17 and Java 8, so you will either need JDK 17 or JRE 8 to successfully run the .jar file.

On Windows, once Java has been installed, you should be able to just double click the jar file to run the project. Unfortunately, due to time and financial constraints we were not able to test this on any other OS (although because it is .jar, you should still be able to run it as long as you have Java installed, there just might be additional steps to make it run by double clicking).
