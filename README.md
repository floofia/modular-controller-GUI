# Modular Controller - GUI

## Description
All code related to any GUI built for interfacing with the modular controller we are making for our senior capstone project.

### User Settings GUI
Initially was the presentation GUI but due to changes made on the controller side the front end design changed and we converted the presentation project into the main GUI project. 
Purpose is to make editing settings of controller more accessible to average user.
