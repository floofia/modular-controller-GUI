# Modular Controller - GUI

## Description
All code related to any GUI built for interfacing with the modular controller we are making for our senior capstone project.
The code held here will relate to one of the following sub-projects

### Presentation GUI
This was a messy and frankly ugly GUI thrown together for the sole-purpose of having a demo at the end of our first semester of work. It will likely not be updated after initial push since it has served its purpose.

### Controller Management GUI 
Desktop app that allows users to manage the key mapping and settings on their modular controller.

### Hosted site
Webpage built with the intention of making it easier for users to access our project when it becomes public. Central location for instructional documents and videos, links to relevant code repos, and any other help documents we find necessary.
